# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL
## CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN

### Project Overview
This project builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, and aims to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, and cats.

### Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Develop a CNN for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Visualize model performance through accuracy and loss plots.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy on training and validation data.

### Dataset
- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10
- **Images:** 60,000 32x32 color images
- **Classes:** 10 (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck)
- **Training Samples:** 50,000
- **Test Samples:** 10,000

### Technologies and Libraries Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas

### Implementation
### Key Steps:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded and normalized to improve training efficiency.
2. **Model Building:**
   - A CNN is constructed with multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling, and dense layers to extract features and classify images.
3. **Training and Validation:**
   - The model is compiled using Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.
   - The CNN is trained for 10 epochs, and training history is recorded.
4. **Visualization:**
   - Training and validation accuracy/loss plots are generated to evaluate model performance.

### Visualization of Results
To analyze the model’s performance, the code includes plots for:
- **Training and Validation Accuracy** – Displays how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
- **Training and Validation Loss** – Indicates model convergence and highlights potential overfitting or underfitting.

### Results
- The model demonstrates effective classification capabilities on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Accuracy and loss plots illustrate the progression of model learning, enabling further tuning for better performance.

### How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
```
